How to compute the Weibull distribution parameters from a wind speed time series

Robin Roche, UTBM, 2013 - robin.roche/at/utbm.fr

For more information about the Weibull distribution, see:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution

The attached file (wind_speed.xls) contains a wind speed time series, with a time resolution of 10 minutes over several months.

Weibull parameters are extracted from the data using the graphical method described in the following papers:
